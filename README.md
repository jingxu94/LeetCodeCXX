# C++ LeetCode Solutions Repo

This is a simple C++ test repository that demonstrates a basic project structure and contains a simple "Hello, World!" program.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```

├── README.md
├── include
│  └── doctest.h
└── src
   ├── CMakeLists.txt
